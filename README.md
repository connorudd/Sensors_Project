## Software and Hardware Requirements
The software requirements for running the simulation code inculded in this Repository are Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox, and specifically the DoBot Magician UTS robot model. This model includes all of the .ply files of each
robotic link and the method to create the robot in the correct orientation and correct DH parameters. Along with this the MATLAB support package for USB cameras for connection and access to the Intel RealSense RGB-D
camera. This coding solution also requires wireless connection to a Raspberry Pi 4 to access the DoBot Magician's ROS topics.
